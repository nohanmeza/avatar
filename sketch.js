    //This was fun to do, and I could feel myself getting faster at it. However, all of this would be much easier if I actually knew where a coordinate would land AKA some way of knowing where the X, Y, coordinates are. I tried to create a cookie with a crown, because of my username (Mightycookie) I think it turned out ok, in a funnyDIY way (I'm trying to say it's ugly.) I hope I actually get faster at this.
